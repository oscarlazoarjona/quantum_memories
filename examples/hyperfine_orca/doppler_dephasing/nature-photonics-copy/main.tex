\maketitle

\textbf{Light is an ideal information carrier for quantum networks \cite{Kimble2008}: its quantum properties are not degraded by noise in ambient conditions and it has a large information capacity owing to its high bandwidth. The realisation of scalable high-speed photonic quantum networks, e.g. for quantum simulation and information processing, requires noise-free, low-latency, and technically simple quantum optical memories to overcome the exponentially poor scaling of current approaches based on linear optics. While low noise \cite{Chaneliere2005,Zhou2012,Maxwell2013,Ding2016,Distante2017,Seri2017}, high speed \cite{England2015}, and operation in ambient conditions \cite{Julsgaard2004,Hosseini2011,Ripka2016,Sibalic2016} have been shown separately, to date no atomic system satisfies all these desiderata simultaneously. Here we introduce the off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA) memory, and demonstrate for the first time the storage and recall of GHz-bandwidth single photons with zero added noise in a warm caesium vapour. Because of its technical simplicity, its high speed and its low noise, ORCA provides a viable route towards next generation, low-latency quantum-network technologies.}


The basic operating principle of a quantum optical memory is to prepare an empty storage state $|s\rangle$ and then map on-demand a quantum state of light to and from an atomic coherence between the ground state $|g\rangle$ and $|s\rangle$. With an additional intermediate atomic level $|e\rangle$ and an auxiliary control field this can be achieved - the input ``signal'' field drives the ``populated transition'' $(|g\rangle \leftrightarrow |e\rangle)$, while the control field drives the ``empty transition'' $(|e\rangle \leftrightarrow |s\rangle)$, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:figFig1}. By using atomic ensembles, one increases the probability of a photon interacting with an atom, leading to strong light-matter coupling \cite{Thomas2016}. Traditionally the energy levels are arranged in a $\Lambda$ configuration: two ground states coupled via an excited state, since the long ground state coherence time gives prospects for long-distance quantum communication applications \cite{Bussieres2013}. Narrowband ($\sim$MHz), resonant $\Lambda$-type quantum optical memories based on electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) \cite{Chaneliere2005,Eisaman2005}, gradient echo memory (GEM) \cite{Hosseini2011} and the full atomic frequency comb (AFC) \cite{Jobez2015} protocol have performed well, with high efficiency \cite{Hedges2010} and preservation of photon statistics \cite{Seri2017} being demonstrated. However, their experimentally accessible narrow bandwidths combined with the additional need for preparation of the storage state (by means of optical pumping or spectral holeburning) limits their maximum clock-rate. Focussing on the requirements of local quantum networks, being able to operate at a high clock-rate for elementary building block synchronisation motivates the need for a broadband memory for short pulses of light \cite{Nunn2013}.

The $\Lambda$ configuration does allow the freedom of having the signal and control fields far-off single-photon resonance while remaining in two-photon resonance, as in the Raman memory scheme \cite{Reim2010a,Chrapkiewicz2017}. In this protocol, the control creates a broadband ``virtual'' resonance that the signal couples to. Because the signal is far detuned from the ``real'' atomic resonance, there is very little linear absorption. Interestingly, this means the system can be reduced to a beamsplitter-like interaction between different travelling optical modes and a stationary matter mode, where the ``reflectivity'' of the beamsplitter is determined by the storage and recall efficiencies \cite{Reim2012,Campbell2014,Fisher2016}. The caveat is that, in the absence of atomic selection rules, the control can off-resonantly couple to the populated transition, inducing spontaneous Raman scattering and polluting the storage state with spurious atomic excitations \cite{Michelberger2015}. The latter leads to four-wave mixing (FWM) noise in the same optical mode as the desired quantum signal when the memory is read out, deteriorating its photon statistics \cite{England2015,Michelberger2015}. Noise contamination of the signal, due to control field induced fluorescence or especially FWM in off-resonant broadband memories, remains one of the greatest challenges prohibiting network ready quantum memories.

\end{figure}

Here we introduce a new quantum memory scheme based on off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA) in a three-level ladder configuration that is optimised for warm atomic vapours (see Fig. \ref{fig:figFig1}). The operational principle is similar to the Raman memory: two broadband optical fields, signal and control, satisfy a two-photon resonance condition with a storage state, while individually being far-off resonance from their respective single-photon transitions. Unlike in $\Lambda$-type protocols, the ORCA memory bandwidth is not in principle limited by the ground state splitting, and the counter-propagating beam geometry reduces motional-induced dephasing of the stored coherence (see Supplementary Information), giving the potential for functional time-bandwidth products, i.e. the number of clock-cycles over which a memory allows synchronisation \cite{Finkelstein2017}.

In the new scheme, the storage state is a doubly-excited electronic state, which has no thermal excitations even at high temperatures. Therefore the protocol in principle requires no preparation of the atomic ensemble prior to storage, and there is no contamination of the recalled fields due to imperfect optical pumping. This points to the major benefit of ORCA storage in that it is {\it noise-free}. The signal and control wavelengths can be chosen such that the control photons are significantly detuned from the populated transition (THz detunings are readily available in the rich atomic structure of alkalis). This effectively eliminates any control field induced fluorescence noise. More importantly though, due to the ladder configuration, there is no scattering process that could populate the storage state, and so four-wave mixing noise is eliminated. Finally, efficient suppression of control field leakage on the output detection is readily achievable using off-the-shelf low-loss interference filters, and bolstered by the counter-propagating field configuration, in principle enabling \emph{end-to-end} device efficiencies approaching the \emph{internal} memory efficiency. The ORCA scheme is therefore a broadband and noise-free quantum optical memory protocol operating within a technically simple, room-temperature platform.

As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we implement the protocol with near-infrared light in warm caesium vapour (see Methods section for more details). We interface the ORCA memory with a 1 GHz bandwidth heralded single-photon source based on parametric down-conversion (PDC) \cite{Michelberger2015}, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:figFig2}. In type-II PDC, a ``pump'' field is converted into orthogonally polarised pairs of photons by means of spontaneous scattering. In the weakly-pumped regime, when the pair production rate is low, the detection of a photon in one of the modes (``idler'') heralds the presence of another (``signal''), which we attempt to store.  We choose a storage time of 3.5 ns, as residual motion-induced dephasing limits the memory lifetime in the current implementation in Cs vapour to 5.4 ns (see Supplementary Information). Owing to the short lifetime, and without the need for time-consuming atomic state preparation, we are able to operate the experiment at the full 80~MHz repetition rate of our pump, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:figFig3}a.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{\textbf{Experimental setup.} \textbf{a,} Photon pairs at 852 nm are generated in parametric down-conversion (PDC) and consecutively filtered (F) to $\sim1$ GHz bandwidth. The signal (s) and idler (i) photons are separated on a polarizing beam splitter (PBS). While the idler photons are detected with a single-photon detector ($\mathrm{D_i}$), the signal photons are sent to the memory. \textbf{b, } Dichroic mirrors (DM) are used to combine the signal field with a bright, counter-propagating control field at 917 nm (read-in and read-out) inside a caesium vapour cell. After the memory, the transmitted and recalled light is sent to the detection stage. \textbf{c, } At the detection stage, the signal photons are split on a balanced beam splitter (BS) and detected by two single-photon detectors ($\mathrm{D_{s1}}$ and $\mathrm{D_{s2}}$) in a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss configuration.}

Fig. \ref{fig:figFig3}a shows a section of the photon arrival time trace with the control field off (``SIG'') and on (``MEM''). We measure a memory efficiency (storage and recall) of $\eta=14.6\pm1.9\;\%$. Higher efficiencies can be reached by stronger driving, increased atomic density, and appropriate shaping of the control pulse, as predicted by existing theory of quantum memories based on three-level systems \cite{Nunn2007,Novikova2007,Gorshkov2007}. Due to the absence of four-wave mixing gain \cite{Thomas2016} however, ORCA is in principle capable of reaching these high efficiencies without adding noise.

We benchmark the noise performance of the memory by evaluating $\mu_1=\langle n^\mathrm{noise}\rangle/\eta$, i.e. the ratio of the average number of noise photons per control pulse $\langle n^\mathrm{noise}\rangle$ and $\eta$ \cite{Gundogan2015}. We find $\mu_1\leq(39.4\pm0.2)\times10^{-6}$, the lowest ever reported from an atom-based quantum memory. Note that the measured $\mu_1$ is an upper bound, limited by the technical noise (dark counts) of our detectors.

To verify the quantum performance of the memory we measure the photon number statistics and correlations of the recalled signal, and compare it with the input. Fig. \ref{fig:figFig3}b shows the detected coincidence clicks between the detectors $\mathrm{D_{i}}$ \& $\mathrm{D_{s1/2}}$ at different times with the control off (``SIG'') and on (``MEM''). First, we evaluate the cross-correlation function $g^{(1,1)}$ of signal and idler photons (see Methods section). Values of $g^{(1,1)}>2$ signify non-classical correlations \cite{Farrera2016}. We measure $g^{(1,1)}=131.3\pm0.2$ for the input signal field, and upon recall obtain $g^{(1,1)}=120.0\pm0.1$, clearly exceeding the classical bound and demonstrating the preservation of non-classical correlations in ORCA. We attribute the reduction of the $g^{(1,1)}$ in the read-out to dark count contamination.

\caption{\textbf{Storage of single photons using ORCA.}\newline \textbf{a,} Histogram showing timing of total signal detector clicks with respect to external 1 MHz trigger. ``SIG'' is the signal field with the control field off, ``MEM'' is the signal field with the control on for a storage time of 3.5 ns. ``CTRL'' has the control field on, but with no input signal. Any photons detected in the ``CTRL'' configuration correspond to noise generated in the memory. \textbf{b,} Histogram of the time difference $\Delta t$ between idler and total signal detector clicks, with the control off (``SIG'') and on (``MEM''). The blue (orange) shaded areas correspond to the integration windows for the SIG (MEM) setting. The peaks at 12.5 and 16 ns in the ``MEM'' trace come from consecutive control pulses reading out residual coherence (see Supplementary Information). \textbf{c,} Input signal: orange - histogram of the time difference $\Delta t$ between idler detector clicks, and signal detector coincidences, i.e. triple coincidence histogram $R_\mathrm{trip}$; blue - product of the two-fold coincidences between the idler and two signal detectors, $R_\mathrm{s1,i}$ and $R_\mathrm{s2,i}$, normalized by the idler counts $R_\mathrm{i}$, i.e. predicted triple coincidence histogram for coherent light of the same average photon rate as the PDC. The ratio between the two histograms corresponds to the measured heralded auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}$. \textbf{d,} Same as \textbf{c}, but for the recalled signal.}
\label{fig:figFig3}
\end{figure}


In order to determine whether ORCA preserves the quantum statistics of the input, we next evaluate the second-order heralded auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}$ (see Methods section). A value of $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}<1$ is a direct measure of quantum statistics, with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}=0$ corresponding to a perfect single photon \cite{Zhou2012}. We measure the $g_\mathrm{h}^{(2)}$ of our input signal (Fig. \ref{fig:figFig3}c) to be $0.020\pm0.005$, as expected from a weakly pumped PDC source \cite{Michelberger2015}. Upon recall (Fig. \ref{fig:figFig3}d), we obtain $g_\mathrm{h}^{(2)}=0.028\pm0.009$, the lowest ever measured from a room-temperature quantum memory. The agreement between input and output $g_\mathrm{h}^{(2)}$ provides further strong experimental confirmation that the atomic memory adds zero noise, similarly to a non-atomic memory based on electronically switched free-space cavities \cite{Kaneda2015}.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the first noise-free broadband atomic quantum memory protocol at room temperature, based on off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA), successfully storing and recalling a single photon from a warm vapour containing $\sim10^{10}$ moving atoms interacting with $\sim10^{9}$ control photons.

In the current experiment in Cs we achieved a time-bandwidth product of $\sim5$. By using a different atomic species with smaller signal/control wavelength mismatch, the memory lifetime can be significantly extended. Recently, Finkelstein et al. \cite{Finkelstein2017} demonstrated a fast ladder memory (FLAME) —-- equivalent to ORCA when far-detuned —-- with classical signal pulses in rubidium vapour. Here, the near-degeneracy of the signal and control fields allowed close to Doppler-free operation, with a memory lifetime $\sim85$ ns, granting Finkelstein et al. a time-bandwidth product of $\sim50$.

With foreseeable improvements in memory efficiency and lifetime, ORCA will be capable of achieving the performance necessary for high clock-rate synchronisation of probabilistic operations in local quantum networks \cite{Nunn2013}. Furthermore, ORCA is compatible with waveguide structures \cite{Sprague2014,Kaczmarek2015}, enabling efficient interfacing with integrated optical circuits \cite{Harris2017}. This will facilitate the creation of photonic quantum states of unprecedented scale, opening the way to a new regime of quantum simulation, computation and sensing.
