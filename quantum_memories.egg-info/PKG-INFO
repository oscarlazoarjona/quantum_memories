Description: Quantum Memories
        =====
        This is a repository for solvers for the Maxwell-Bloch equations of
        various quantum memories, and calculations using them.
        
        Installing
        --------
        This software requires pip and git to be installed. These can be installed as
        "Anaconda Python 2.7" and "GIT Version Control System" from the department's
        self-service application for Windows, or downloaded and manually installed from
        https://www.continuum.io/downloads and https://git-scm.com/downloads.
        
        Once Anaconda and git are installed, the Python package quantum_memories can be
        installed with
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install git+git://github.com/oscarlazoarjona/quantum_memories
        
        To upgrade to the latest functionality use
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install git+git://github.com/oscarlazoarjona/quantum_memories --upgrade
        
        To uninstall use
        
        ::
        
            $ pip uninstall quantum_memories
        
        Using Quantum Memories
        --------
        
        The source code can be downloaded from
        
        https://github.com/oscarlazoarjona/quantum_memories
        
        and the Python scripts in the examples folder should run once the package
        is installed.
        
        Enjoy!
